# Social-Network-API

## Description

This project creates functionality for a social network website through an API.  It has all basic social network features including, creating a user account, adding/deleting friends, creating/deleting thoughts and reacting to those thoughts.  The motivation behind this project was to really figure out how social network websites work.  I learned how to use MongoDB more effectively and had a lot of fun creating this!
